## Architecture and Technologies


This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic
- `HTML5 Canvas` for rendering


## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Set up Node modules and basic entry files.  Get background rendering with canvas and research iterating through image files for animation.

**Day 2**: Key control logic and rendering character movement and ghouls coming at the character

**Day 3**:  Collision detection to determine if the game is over or user wins a point

**Day 4**: Polish game, create modals and NavLinks
